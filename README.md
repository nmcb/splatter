Splatter provides a Software Isle within the internet sea of things.  The internet of things, or IoT as the phrase is currently abbreviated, can imaganatively seen comprised of real world, physical entities, distributed in space and time.  The most important aspect of these entities, these things, is that they communicate, that they convey information.  Some entities emit information, they don't react or sometimes even observe all the information that is communicated to them.  This category of entities seems unconscious, they are the static ones.  (Which is not to say that this category of information emitting entities needs to be static in space or time, on the contrary, some of them may very well be on the move all the time.)  Other categories of internet things act completely different, they long for the information that is emited by other entities, they react on it.  This reacting category of entities often collects information and prosesses it.  These entities change their behavior depending on the information they receive or observe and may even change their behavioral ways, in space and time bot especially in the ways they communicate with each other and all other entities.  Reacting entities in the internet of things seem contious, they act intentionally [1].
